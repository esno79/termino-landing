<div class="line">Hello! I‚Äôm looking to get some insurance, but I‚Äôm not sure what type I need.</div>
<div class="line">Hi! I‚Äôd be happy to help. Are you interested in life insurance, health insurance, auto insurance, or property insurance?</div>
<div class="line">I think I need health insurance primarily. My medical expenses have been increasing.</div>
<div class="line">That makes sense. We offer several health insurance plans that cover different medical services. Do you have a preference for a comprehensive plan or a more basic one?</div>
<div class="line">I‚Äôd prefer something comprehensive that covers preventive care as well.</div>
<div class="line">Excellent choice! Additionally, have you considered life insurance? It‚Äôs important if you have dependents.</div>
<div class="line">I haven‚Äôt thought about it much. What type of life insurance would you recommend?</div>
<div class="line">Term life insurance is often a good starting point because it‚Äôs more affordable and covers you for a specific period. Would you like more information on that?</div>
<div class="line">Yes, please! I‚Äôd like to understand the benefits and costs involved.</div>
